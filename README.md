## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

### Prerequisites

You will need Flutter installed to run this project.  Follow the [official Flutter install guide](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install).
This project is built with Flutter v1.0.0.

It is important to follow all the recommendations provided by the command `flutter doctor` to ensure you have fully installed Flutter.

It is safe to ignore the 'Connected Devices' section to confirm the install, Connected Devices are currently connected devices, which will change based on emulators / simulators running, or phones plugged in.

If you do want to test this, launch the iOS simulator (MacOS only) and/or Android emulator and verify that `flutter doctor` registers connected devices.

### Installing
